As application development moves more and more toward hosted applications and services, Microsoft has developed a premier infrastructure to support enterprise cloud application development.</p><p>Windows Azure is made up of components that allow it to be utilized in many different capacities. It is possible to build web applications that run and store their data in Microsoft datacenters.
